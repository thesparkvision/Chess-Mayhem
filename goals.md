There are goals that this project aim to achieve

- I have played chess before, but now I want to know how I put those same constraints where user won't go outside the 8x8 board
  and two players can be distinguished and what blocks a piece can run into is decided - specially for a game like chess.
  Matrix (array of arrays) is one of the tricky and also amusing data structure and it has great application in chess. 

- I want to learn how programmers have designed a computer AI (don't know if that is AI lol) which thinks and chooses what step to take to beat the human player in advance, and with different version of difficulties - implying that computer can be purposely made less intelligent and build the same.

- I want to go a step further and build a version where two computer AIs can compete in a chess game and we are just watchers of that game.

- Also, with this, want to learn more about game development and maybe use more of python tooling I haven't been exposed to like uv. I just got to know what is SDL2 and Odin and game loop. So, a good start.
